# Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Dashboard

An interactive data visualization dashboard built using **D3.js** to explore seasonal influenza vaccination coverage across the United States. Users can filter by state, flu season, race/ethnicity, and estimate type to view monthly trends, yearly comparisons, and sample sizes.
